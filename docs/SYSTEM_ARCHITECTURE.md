# Amanah Institute — System Architecture

A single, structured reference for the whole platform. Use this for product, design, and engineering alignment.

**Target users:** Ages 15–35  
**Tone:** Modern, clean, disciplined, wealth-focused  
**Product feel:** A wealth operating system — not a content site or a generic app.

---

## 1. Overall Purpose

Amanah Institute is an **all-in-one halal wealth platform** that helps users:

- **Learn** how to build income (Business Academy)
- **Invest** in sharia-compliant ways (automated + self-directed)
- **Connect** with others (Community)
- **Give** correctly (Zakat, Sadaqah, Sadaqah Jariyah)
- **Build** their brand and marketing (Workspace)

The platform has **one main app home** (Dashboard) and **feature-specific homes** (Trading Dashboard Home, Academy Dashboard Home) so each pillar has a clear landing and next steps.

---

## 2. Platform Pillars (High Level)

| Pillar        | Route base         | Purpose in one line                          |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Dashboard     | `/dashboard`       | Central control: net worth, next action, feeds |
| Trading       | `/invest`, `/trade`| Halal investing + self-directed trading      |
| Academy       | `/academy`         | Business education and builder progress     |
| Workspace     | `/workspace`       | Internal branding, logo, ads, workflows      |
| Community     | `/community`       | Channels, chat, DMs, collab                  |
| Zakat         | `/zakat`           | Calculator, history, charity giving          |
| Profile       | `/profile`         | Identity, family accounts, settings         |

---

## 3. Onboarding

- **When:** After signup; optional steps if user already exists.
- **Stored:** Experience level, risk tolerance, chosen path (business | investing | both), goals.
- **Paths:** Business path, Investing path, Both.
- **Outcome:** Default accounts created (e.g. holding); user directed to the right home (dashboard, then academy or invest based on path).

**Implemented:** `GET/POST /api/onboarding`; experience level, risk profile, onboarding path, goals; default account creation.

**Path-specific onboarding (after initial focus choice):**
- **Academy personalization** — When user clicks “Personalize My Business Academy”: questionnaire at `/academy/onboarding` (experience level, pathway, current stage, income goal, goals). `POST /api/onboarding/academy` saves answers and sets `academyPersonalizedAt`. Once complete → redirect to `/academy`.
- **Trading account opening** — When user clicks “Open My Trading Account”: questionnaire at `/invest/onboarding` (risk profile). `POST /api/onboarding/trading` ensures holding/investment/self-directed accounts exist, sets risk profile, sets `tradingAccountOpenedAt`. Once complete → redirect to `/invest`.

Dashboard hero CTAs link to onboarding URLs when not yet completed; after completion they link to the feature home.

---

## 4. Home Overviews

There are **three home surfaces** (no duplication of logic):

1. **Main app home (Dashboard)** — `/dashboard`  
   Central overview for the whole product.

2. **Trading dashboard home** — `/invest` (or `/invest/home`)  
   Landing when the user is in “investing” mode: portfolio snapshot, quick trade, watchlist teaser, market pulse.

3. **Academy dashboard home** — `/academy`  
   Landing for learning: progress, “continue lesson”, income goal, next actions, modules.

## 12. UI Consistency Notes

- **Homes:** One main dashboard home; one trading home; one academy home. No duplicate “home” logic.
- **Navigation:** Persistent left sidebar; Watchlist, Screener, Analysis as sidebar options in Trading to reduce clutter.
- **Market & news:** Single full-screen market & news page (from dashboard or trading); news by sentiment and analysis (bullish/bearish, volatility).
- **Workspace:** One workspace per user; “My workspace” panel → full-screen workspace.
- **Academy:** One academy dashboard home; “My academy dashboard” panel → academy home.

This document is the single source of truth for the platform’s structure. Refinements (e.g. 1h/3d top gainers, charity foundations, DMs/collab) should be added here and then implemented in code.
